\abschnitt{Overview}
The purpose of this paper is to foreshadow a forthcoming proposal to introduce
fibers to the C++ standard library; to briefly describe the features in the
proposed fiber library; and to contrast it with the coroutine library proposed
in \docr.\\
\newline
It is hoped that this comparison will help to clarify the feature set of the
proposed coroutine library. Certain features properly belong in the coroutine
library; other conceptually-related features more properly belong in the fiber
library.
