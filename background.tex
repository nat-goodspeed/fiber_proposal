\abschnitt{Background}
A coroutine library was initially proposed in \doc; the proposal was
subsequently revised in \docr. Some of the ensuing discussion suggests that,
for purposes of refining the coroutine proposal, it might be useful for the
authors to disambiguate the conceptual space addressed by the coroutine
library from the conceptual space addressed by the fiber library.
